A data structure consisting of nodes connected to other nodes with edges
- **Order:** The number of vertices in the graph
- **Size:** The number of edges in the graph
- **Vertex degree:** The number of edges that are incident to a vertex
- **Isolated vertex:** A vertex that is not connected to any other vertices in the graph
- **Self-loop**: An edge from a vertex to itself
- **Directed graph:** A graph where all the edges have a direction indicating what is the start vertex and what is the end vertex
- **Undirected graph:** A graph with edges that have no direction
- **Weighted graph:** Edges of the graph has weights
- **Unweighted graph:** Edges of the graph has no weights
